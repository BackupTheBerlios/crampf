FEATURE WISHLIST
	* add printf command which should support many %x directives
	  (e.g. CurrentTrackNum, Playlistlength, Current-Track-Name etc.)
	  this could supersede the status-command 
	* add more information to info command:
	    * information from track database:
		* times played, times skipped, last time played
	    * length of song (e.g. madtime for .mp3)
	    * probably add addinfo command similiar to addplayer
	* Change options-struct into a map with fixed keys, initialized by the
	      constructor
	    * this map could be read and set by the user through set command
	* add score command: if called with no args it shows the score
	    of the current track, a relative or absolute numeric argument can
	    be given to adjust current score
	    score could be a value between 0.0 and 100.0 initialized with 50.0
	    (a random playlist could probably be sorted by score?)
	    * add score filter command to filter out tracks with a score
	      within a given range
	    * add autocommand thats triggered after skipping a song
		(by default it could be mapped to score -5)
	    * add autocommand thats triggered when volume is increased, and one thats
		triggered when volume is decreased (could be mapped to score +1)
	* add generic function for relative / absolute changes on a number
	    should be able to parse +x, -x, *x, /x and handle floats and ints
	* Change the hardcoded defaults to something more useful (my config? :)
	* remove global objects ('extern bla...')
	* create a real exception class (get rid of throwing strings)
	* Integrate slang scripting language

KNOWN BUGS
	* When loop is set to infinitive and the playlist (or the playercommand)
	      is invalid the program hangs in an endless loop (don't know how to
	      handle this probably).
