FEATURE WISHLIST
	* Change the hardcoded defaults to something more useful
	* Change options-struct into a map with fixed keys, initialized by the
	      constructor
	* Simple and flexible way to execute external commands
	* More generic player interface (e.g. alsaplayer + alsaremotectrl)
	    * create abstract player interface
	    * probably using plugins?
	* id3v2tag support (e.g. libid3, id3v2)
	* create a real exception class (get rid of throwing strings)
	* Support for MODs, S3Ms, etc.
	* Integrate slang scripting language

KNOWN BUGS
	* When loop is set to infinitive and the playlist (or the playercommand)
	      is invalid the program hangs in an endless loop (don't know how to
	      handle this probably).
