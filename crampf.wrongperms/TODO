FEATURE WISHLIST
	* Change options-struct into a map with fixed keys, initialized by the
	      constructor
	    * this map could be read and set by the user through set command
	* add score command: if called with no args it shows the score
	    of the current track, a relative or absolute numeric argument can
	    be given to adjust current score
	    score should be a value between 0 and 100 initialized with 50
	    (a random playlist could probably be sorteb by score?)
	* add autocommand thats triggered after skipping a song
	    (by default it could be mapped to score -5)
	* add autocommand thats triggered when volume is increased, and one thats
	    triggered when volume is decreased (could be mapped to score +1)
	* add generic function for relative / absolute changes on a number
	    should be able to parse +x, -x, *x, /x and handle floats and ints
	* Change the hardcoded defaults to something more useful
	* remove global objects ('extern bla...')
	* Simple and flexible way to execute external commands
	    * make aumix, mpg3info, amp better configurable
	    * let configure check at least for amp, mpg123, mpg321, freeamp, alsaplayer
	      and choose a default that exists on the target system
	* More generic player interface (e.g. alsaplayer + alsaremotectrl)
	    * probably using plugins?
	* create a real exception class (get rid of throwing strings)
	* Support for MODs, S3Ms, etc.
	* Integrate slang scripting language

KNOWN BUGS
	* stop /dev/dsp busy waiting in player/stdplayer
	* When loop is set to infinitive and the playlist (or the playercommand)
	      is invalid the program hangs in an endless loop (don't know how to
	      handle this probably).
	* doesn't compile with gcc 2.95.3 (but works with egcs 2.91.66)
