REQUIREMENTS
	To use crampf you some of the following programs installed:
	    * a simple console based mp3-player (e.g. amp, mpg123, etc. defaults
		to amp)
	    * mp3info (I use version 0.2.16) for id3-tags, time and bitrate
	    	information
	    * aumix to change sound volume

	You also need some libraries and headerfiles installed, but this is
	hopefully checked by the configure script.


INSTALL
	Installation should be quite easy, just do

	$./configure
	$make
	$make install

	To use another mp3-player instead of amp write the following
	two lines in your $HOME/.crampfrc:
		playercmd 	<mp3-playername>
		playercmd_args 	<mp3-player parameters>

	For use with mpg123 for example use the following:
		playercmd	mpg123
		playercmd_args	-q

	If you have any trouble during compilation please send a detailed
	bugreport containing the configure and the make output to Kevin Loos
	<logic@tzi.de>.


Please see README for a little documentation.
