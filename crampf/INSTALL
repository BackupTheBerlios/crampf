REQUIREMENTS
	To use crampf you need some of the following programs installed:
	    * a simple console based mp3-player (e.g. madplay, alsaplayer,
	      mpg321, amp, mpg123, etc.)
	    * libid3tag (which is part of mad) or mp3info (I use version
	      0.2.16) for id3-tags, time and bitrate information
	    * aumix to change sound volume

	You also need some libraries and headerfiles installed, but this is
	hopefully checked by the configure script.


INSTALL
	Installation should be quite easy, just do

	$./configure
	$make
	$make install

	To use a mp3-player which is not supported out of the box write the
	following line to your $HOME/.crampfrc:
		addplayer 	<playercmd> <player args> /\.mp3$/ 1.0
	(for details see :help addplayer)

	If you have any trouble during compilation please send a detailed
	bugreport containing the configure and the make output to Kevin Loos
	<logic@tzi.org>.


Please see README for a little documentation.
