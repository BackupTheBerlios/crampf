OVERVIEW
	Crampf is a console based mp3-player frontend with a ``vi-like''
	interface.


INSTALL
	Please see INSTALL for a quick installation guide.


DOCUMENTATION
	The program should be quite self-explanatory. For commandline parameters
	check `--help', to see the current hotkey-mappings press `h' during
	playback and `:help' to see all available commands. For a detailed help
	on each command enter `:help <commandname>'.
	For configuring the default behavior create a file $HOME/.crampfrc
	you may use any commands in this file which you would otherwise enter in
	the `:' mode.


BUGREPORTS
	I would be very happy to see any kind of (detailed) bugreports,
	feature-wishes or whatever. Just mail them to Kevin Loos <logic@tzi.de>.
